## Getting Started üöÄ  
**Prerequisites**  
- C++ compiler with C++11 support (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)  
- Standard C++ libraries  

**Compilation**  
```
bash # Using g++ (recommended)    
g++ -std=c++11 -o todo_app TODO_App.cpp  
```
```
# Or using clang++  
clang++ -std=c++11 -o todo_app TODO_App.cpp  
```
**Running the Application**  
```
./todo_app  
```
## Usage üìñ  
When you run the application, you'll see an interactive menu with the following options:  
**Main Menu Options**  

Add Task - Create a new task with description and urgency level  
View All Tasks - Display all tasks in a formatted table  
View Tasks Sorted by Urgency - Show tasks sorted by priority  
Mark Task as Completed - Mark a specific task as done  
Remove Task - Delete a task permanently  
View Statistics - Show task counts and urgency breakdown  
Export Tasks - Save tasks to file (TXT/CSV/JSON)  
Clear Completed Tasks - Remove all completed tasks
